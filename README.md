# 🚀 Web Development Learning Portfolio

A collection of web development projects built during my learning journey. These projects demonstrate my progress in mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals while exploring modern web development practices.

> **Learning Methodology:** As a beginner developer, I utilize AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) as learning aids alongside official documentation, online tutorials, and hands-on practice. I ensure I understand every line of code I implement, treating AI as a mentor to accelerate comprehension rather than a replacement for genuine learning.
